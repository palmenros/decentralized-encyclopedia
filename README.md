# Decentralized Encyclopedia

This repository contains a detailed report for a decentralized rich-text encyclopedia to prevent censorship and support diverse viewpoints. Utilizing a rich-text CRDT primitive for merging asynchronous modifications, each node can propose and view unique article modifications based on votes from a Web of Trust network. Users can manually explore alternatives, and a global reputation system using EigenTrust ranks nodes according to their contributions. The system is designed to be sybil-resistant and partially byzantine fault-tolerant, with extensive testing ensuring scalability.

The code was implemented as a final project for EPFL's Decentralized System Engineering CS-438 course, and cannot be released due to the professor's explicit request. Therefore, only the report is available in this repository.
